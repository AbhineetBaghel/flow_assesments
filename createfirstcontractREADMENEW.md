Hello World
This is an assesment of flow in metacrafters. In this assesment I have written a smart contract using struct in cadence.

Description

Smart Contract - A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It is an integral part of blockchain technology, particularly associated with decentralized platforms like Ethereum. Smart contracts allow for the automation and enforcement of agreements, eliminating the need for intermediaries and enhancing trust and transparency in transactions.

Cadence- Cadence is a programming language specifically designed for developing smart contracts on the Flow blockchain. Flow is a blockchain platform created by Dapper Labs, the team behind popular blockchain-based games like CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot.
